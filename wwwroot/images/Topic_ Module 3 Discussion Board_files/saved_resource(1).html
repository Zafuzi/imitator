TCP and UDP are the two types of IP traffic. TCP is often used in scenarios where connection reliability is important, whereas UDP is used more frequently when latency is a greater issue.</p><p>Because UDP is a connectionless protocol, meaning that it can send information without connecting to the recipient or waiting for a callback, it is commonly used in VoIP calls, some gaming instances, and DNS resolving.</p><p>TDP on the other hand is a connection based protocol and must have a solid connection to each node otherwise the connection will be terminated. For this reason HTTP, FTP, and SMTP utilize TCP because it is more reliable than UDP and they are all protocols that rely on a solid connection. This also means that TCP is slower than UDP and less useful in situations that require quick communications like video calling.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2. I think the best way to improve IPv4 is to simply improve security. The way I see it, as soon as IPv6 starts being phased in, many more devices that don't need an IPv6 address (like a smart toaster) would benefit from using IPv4. I think IPv4 would be better used in a home network while IPv6 handles the backbone of the internet. For this reason increasing the general security of IPv4 would be beneficial for every home.</p></body></html>
